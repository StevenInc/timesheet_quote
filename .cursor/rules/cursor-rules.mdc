Stay focused on one task at a time. I want you to ask to proceed when you add additional features.
Respond to each task with the steps to complete the task, but do not execute the step until I approve them. I want to have the ability to edit the steps before proceeding.

Ask to run npm run build instead of npm run dev after code has been modified.

Do not update clientComments if the form is empty
